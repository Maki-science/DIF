# InARes

The framework for the Index of Adaptive Responses provides a simple and 
    fast tool to evaluate challenging data on ‘whole organism’ adaptive responses in complex environments. 
    There are some minor points or cases, where caution is recommended. To provide a powerful tool and 
    high confidence in its utilization, I provided an additional list of recommendations and potential issues 
    that can occur, when applying the framework. The list is provided in the publication but will also be 
    regularly updated and extended in the R package and its web page, to keep track on potential future 
    extensions and occurring issues during the broad applications in various research fields. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of InARes from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

devtools::install_github("Maki-science/InARes")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
