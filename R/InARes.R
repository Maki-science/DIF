#' Calculation of the Index for Adaptive Responses
#' 
#' @description
#' Calculates the Index for Adaptive Responses from several rex transformed traits:
#' if as.defined = TRUE: InARes = sum((-1) * rex(x) / max( |rex|(all treatments) )) / number of parameter
#' or
#' if as.defined = FALSE (default): InARes = sum((-1) * rex(x) / ( max( |rex|(all treatments) )) * median(treatment) / |median(treatment)| ) / number of parameter
#' The (-1) is only necessary, if we believe that the increase of one trait is maladaptive. 
#' rexmax will be 1 when usemc = 1 was selected in rex transformation.
#' At the current state, everything that is not control is considered as one treatment. If there are several 
#' treatments in the data set, we recommend to subset the data accordingly.
#'
#' @param data A data.frame to be used, which contains the rex transformed values of all traits that should be included.
#' @param traits The names of the columns that contains the rex transformed values 
#'        of the traits to be incorporated where the adaptiveness is unknown or an increase is considered an adaptation.
#' @param traits.mal The names of the columns that contains the rex transformed values 
#'        of the traits to be incorporated where an increase is considered as a maladaptation.
#' @param as.defined if TRUE the sign of rexmax will be positive for traits and negative
#'        for traits.mal when used as weighing parameter. If set to FALSE (default) the sign might be 
#'        positive or negative for traits (since their adaptiveness is considered unknown), but always negative for traits.mal.
#'        This parameter is thought for cases where the functionality of the traits are unclear and the Index will be evaluated using dContribution().
#' @param treatCol column name of the treatments (defaults to 'treatment'). At the current state, everything that is not control is
#'        considered as one treatment. If there are several treatments in the data set, we recommend to subset the data accordingly.
#' @param ctrl the name of the control treatment as set in treatCol (defaults to 'control'). 
#' @param rexmax.adapt a vector containing values for rexmax for each trait provided in traits. 
#'        It can be specified, if one wants to calculate values comparable with other experiments or the literature.
#'        rexmax has to be set for all traits or an NA should be included. Order should be similar to as set
#'        in traits. Each value must be between -1 and 1. Defaults to FALSE (not considered unless provided).
#' @param rexmax.mal a vector containing values for rexmax for each trait provided in traits.mal 
#'        (works similar as for rexmax.adapt). Order should be similar to as set in traits.
#'        Each value must be between -1 and 1. Defaults to FALSE (not considered unless provided).
#' @param na.action Defines the way, how NAs are treated (row wise). Can be either "omit", "keep", or "interpolate". 
#'        Defaults to "keep".
#'        When "keep" the InARes value will be NA, if one or more of the trait values contain NA. Usually 
#'        recommended for unbiased estimates! 
#'        In case of "interpolate", it will use the median value of the trait of the current treatment. However, 
#'        this might bias your estimates in some way, if the median of the treatment in this trait is not Â´fitting adequately, 
#'        but it helps if a lot of NAs occur in fields of different traits. We recommend this way, as a conservative
#'        way to prevent NAs. However, if there are a lot of gaps in your trait data, it may bias the outcome strongly.
#'        When "omit" it calculates the InARes with traits where an NA occurs. In this case, NA-traits are 
#'        ignored and number of traits reduced by the number of traits with NA (for each individual). This, however, 
#'        may bias the outcome or the later estimation of each traits' contribution. The values may be misleading. 
#'        This way is not recommended and should only be used if you are certain about what you do!
#' @param as.PI can be set TRUE if the aim is to use this function for calculating an overall plasticity index. 
#'        In this case, all traits should be transformed with Trex(..., usemc = 1). Additionally, all traits
#'        should be provided via traits (not traits.mal) and as.defined should be set TRUE. Now you will receive
#'        values that are measures of the mean deviation over all traits from the control mean.
#'
#' @return Returns a list containing the transformed data and additional information like rexmax.
